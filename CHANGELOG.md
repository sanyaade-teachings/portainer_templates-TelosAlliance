# Changelog

This change log contains the history of changes to the Portainer Templates.

## 1.3.11

* Generic changes:
  * Reintroduced dual-macvlan templates as TACST 1.6.2 introduced a feature to downgrade Docker to a known working version.
  * Fix container categories

## 1.3.10

* Forza FM changes:
  * Release Omnia RDS container as part of Forza FM 2.2.3 update.

## 1.3.9

* Generic changes:
  * Removed dual-macvlan templates due to a Docker issue that causes internal NIC names to be unpredictable, leading to telosmacvlan/ext1macvlan mapping flips. As products implement IP-based mapping, Telos Alliance will restore dual-macvlan templates.

## 1.3.8

* GitHub release skipped.

## 1.3.7

* Generic changes:
  * Migrated the old docker-compose repository to the _raw folder, which now holds the raw compose files.
  * Updated all Portainer Templates labels and relative descriptions in standard 1940-00017.
  * Updated all compose files to match the newly defined tree structure in standard 1940-00017.
  * Add "hostname" where missing or fix where incorrect (not appending the $INSTANCE_NAME) to conform to standard 1940-00017.
  * Remove version from all compose files, as it has been obsoleted.
  * Update external networks declaration to reflect the latest Docker directives.

* Forza changes:
  * Renamed all remaining instances of "Forza" to "Forza HDS" or "Forza FM" accordingly. This fixes a potential conflict where FM and HDS version with the same $INSTANCE_NAME write to the same data folder.
  * Added Forza FM components (Forza & FM Transport) with host networking to edge-templates-v3.
  * Remove IFACE_WEBUI from Forza HDS host compose file as it is deprecated and not needed.
